# In python we can:
# Define a function inside another function.
# Pass a function as an argumenet to another function.
# Return a function inside or from another function

# Defining a function inside another function :


def Outside_function():
    def Inside_Function():
        print("Hey, I am the Inside Function")

    print("Hey, I am the outside Function")
    print(
        "These statemenets are executed before the inside function (Inside function is not called yet)"
    )
    Inside_Function()
    print(
        "This statement is executed after the Inside function(Inside function is called)"
    )


Outside_function()

# Example :
def addition(a, b):
    def add(x, y):
        return x + y

    sum = "The sum is : " + str(add(a, b))
    return sum


a = int(input("Enter the first term : "))
b = int(input("Enter the second term : "))
answer = addition(a, b)
print(answer)

input("Press Enter key to exit ")
