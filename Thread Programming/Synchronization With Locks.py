In the flight reservation program, we used sleep function to prevent the threads from running at once.
However, the more efficient method to do this would be by using the build in class "Lock".

If you noticed in this case, it prints the else statement. 
This is because, the processes are ran one after another.
You can also use Semophores instead of Lock.s
